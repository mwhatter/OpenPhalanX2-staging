Error: /usr/local/share/lua/5.1/kong/cmd/utils/migrations.lua:16: Database needs bootstrapping or is older than Kong 1.0.

To start a new installation from scratch, run 'kong migrations bootstrap'.

To migrate from a version older than 1.0, migrated to Kong 1.5.0 first. 
If you still have 'apis' entities, you can convert them to Routes and Services
using the 'kong migrations migrate-apis' command in Kong 1.5.0.
